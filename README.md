The cleaned dataset is in the file named **"Cleaned_Data"** and **"Review_Data"** in this repository

### Data Analysis
The analysis phase delves into various aspects, such as pricing strategies, customer satisfaction, and product categorization. We delve deep into the relationships between pricing, discounts, and customer ratings, aiming to uncover valuable patterns that can inform business strategies.

### Data Visualization
To enhance the clarity of our findings, we employ a variety of visual tools, including histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots. These visuals help illustrate key trends and insights within the dataset, making the analysis both informative and engaging.

The primary objective of this project is to extract actionable insights from the dataset. It serves as a demonstration of the value of a data-driven approach in comprehending and optimizing e-commerce strategies, particularly in the areas of product pricing and customer engagement.
